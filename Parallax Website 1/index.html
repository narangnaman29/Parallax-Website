      <h2>Mother Nature</h2>
      <p>
        The word "nature" comes from the Latin word, "natura", meaning birth or
        character. In English, its first recorded use (in the sense of the
        entirety of the phenomena of the world) was in 1266.

      <h2>Mother Earth</h2>
      <p>
        Earth is the only planet known to support life, and its natural features
        are the subject of many fields of scientific research. Within the Solar
        System, it is third closest to the Sun; it is the largest terrestrial
        planet and the fifth largest overall. Its most prominent climatic
        features are its two large polar regions, two relatively narrow
        temperate zones, and a wide equatorial tropical to subtropical region.
        Precipitation varies widely with location, from several metres of water
        per year to less than a millimetre. 71 percent of the Earth's surface is
        covered by salt-water oceans.

      <h2>Ecosytems</h2>
      <p>
        Ecosystems are composed of a variety of biotic and abiotic components
        that function in an interrelated way.[41] The structure and composition
        is determined by various environmental factors that are interrelated.
        Variations of these factors will initiate dynamic modifications to the
        ecosystem. Some of the more important components are soil, atmosphere,
        radiation from the sun, water, and living organisms.
